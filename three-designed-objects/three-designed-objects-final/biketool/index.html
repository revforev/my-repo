                   <ul>
                      <li>
                          <p>a. The hook side</p>
                          <p>Use this to pull the tyre out. Once you get hold of the tyre, you will be able to take the tube from under it.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <p>b. The other side</p>
                          <p>After you took the faulty tube off, you’ll want to replace it with a fresh one. We can use this to push the new tube in its place. Job done!</p>

                      <li>

                          <p>c. Lightweight - almost no weight at all</p>

                      <li>
                          <p>d. Smooth</p>
                          <p>Before I found out about this I was using kitchen knives. Of course that’s a bad idea because you could cut your tube, tyre, or much more valuable parts with it. Luckily, there’s no risk in using the tyre tool as it’s made of plastic and has no sharp edges.</p>

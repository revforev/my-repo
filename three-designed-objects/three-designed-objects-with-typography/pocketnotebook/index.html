      <h1>Pocket notebook</h1>
      <p>I like to write down ideas and things. I use my phone for it a lot but itâ€™s definetly not the preferred medium. Iâ€™ll try and explain why: recently I got into journaling â€“ as in keeping track of past experiences â€“ and when I look at the mound of notes on my phone, I donâ€™t like that they look the same. Same background, font. Few emojis</p>
       <p>I prefer reading from a notebook. Itâ€™s an immersive experience. Every page is different and I can even read emotion in the calligraphy: did I write slowly or quickly, did I add colors, did I feel like decorating the page, was I in a hurry, all these are clues of how I felt at that specific moment in time.</p>

       <ul>
       <li><p>a. Size</p>
           <p>

Fits nicely in a pocket. Easy to carry around with no backpacks.</p></li>
<li><p>b. Elastic band</p>

<p>You can be sure it stays closed all the time because of the black elastic band. Hope you can see it in the gif.</p></li>

<li><p>c. Book sign</p>

<p>I always improvise book signs. Luckily, this got the grey lace thing, so no worries!</p></li>       </ul>

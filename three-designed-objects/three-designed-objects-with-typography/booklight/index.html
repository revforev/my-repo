      <h1>Book light</h1>
      <p>Like people do, I used to have trouble sleeping at some point in my life. Once I read a book on how to sleep, best tip I got was try to not look at screens for at least half an hour before bedtime.

</p>
       <p>Took me a little while to quit this habit but eventually I started to read books, just a few pages each night before bed. However the light in my room was a bit dim. So I got me this little book light and the trouble was gone.</p>
       <br>
       <ul>
       <li><p>a. Led
</p>
           <p>
It uses a led light. I’m far from being an electrician but I presume these things consume little energy. There’s also a choice of colors, you’ve got a warm light which is orange-y and a cold one which is white, currently displayed.</p></li>
           
<li><p>b. Clip
</p>

<p>
The clip is a great design choice – you can attach it to any book you like. Boom!</p></li>

<li><p>c. Flexible stem
</p>

<p>
Again this is good design because the light can be adjusted easily with this stem.</p></li>       </ul>

           <br>
           
       <ul>
       <li><p>d. Charging port

</p><p>
Fortunately it doesn’t run on batteries. You can use a typical mini usb cable to charge it up.
</p></li>
